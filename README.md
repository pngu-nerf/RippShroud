Printing:
Print with 5 walls to avoid infill, the parts are pre-oriented and shouldn't need to be changed
 
Description:
A hot swappable shroud can easily be screwed on and off enabling mono-color prints while still achieving designs using multiple colors.
 
Remixes:
The inner rifling is the Thantacles RIPPCAR
 
Design:
If you want to make your own shrouds I have included a file of the outer screw that can be placed on your parts. Below are the dimensions should you prefer to make the threads yourself, It's not proper drafting but hopefully the measurements are legible.
